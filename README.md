# Socket Security Research

This project hosts security advisories and their accompanying
proof-of-concepts related to research conducted at Socket which impact
non-Socket owned code.

We believe that vulnerability disclosure is a two-way street. Vendors,
as well as researchers, must act responsibly. This is why Google adheres
to a 90-day disclosure deadline. We notify vendors of vulnerabilities
immediately, with details shared in public with the defensive community
after 90 days, or sooner if the vendor releases a fix.

You can read up on our full policy at:

## Advisories

The disclosure of vulnerabilities are all in the form of security
advisories, which can be browsed in the [Security
Advisories](https://github.com/SocketDev/security-research/security/advisories?state=published)
page.

# License & Patents

The advisories and patches posted here are free and open source.
